# Star catalog data

`brightstars.csv` (9,093 stars: `vmag,ra,de,pmRa,pmDe,sRgbR,sRgbG,sRgbB`) is
the checked-in source of truth, originally extracted from
[osgHimmel](https://github.com/cgcostume/osghimmel)'s `brightstars.cpp`.

**Provenance:** star positions/magnitudes/proper motion (RA, DE, Vmag, pmRA,
pmDE) originate from the Yale Bright Star Catalogue (BSC5). The sRGB columns
were precomputed for osgHimmel from each star's B-V color index via
`Stars::sRgbColor()`: B-V → color temperature → Planckian locus in CIE xy →
CIE XYZ tristimulus → sRGB.

`brightstars.bin` is generated from the CSV — a flat little-endian
`Float32Array`, matching the original C++ `float` precision:

```sh
pnpm generate:catalog
```

Run that whenever `brightstars.csv` is hand-edited.
